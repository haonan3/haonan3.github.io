  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Washington, Seattle, advised by <a href = "https://ajratner.github.io/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Alex Ratner</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunated to be advised by <a href = "http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Jiawei Han</a>. </p>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">My current research interests are <b>Data Management for Machine Learning</b> with an emphasis on effort-light approach. My ultimate goal is to build an effective, efficient and explainable system to facilitate new task by leveraging knowledge in the form of heuristics, labels and trained models. My past explorations lay in the intersection of data mining, machine learning and natural language processing.</p>
